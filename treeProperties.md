# Properties of a Tree T

(a) T is a tree, which is an acyclic connected graph.

(b) T has no cycles and contains exactly n-1 edges for n vertices.

(c) T is a connected graph with exactly n-1 edges.

(d) If any single edge is removed from T, the graph becomes disconnected into two separate components.

(e) For any two vertices in T, there exists a unique path between them.

(f) T has no cycles, and adding any edge between two existing vertices will create exactly one cycle.

## Additional Clarifications

- A tree is a minimally connected graph with no cycles.
- Each of these properties is equivalent and characterizes a tree uniquely.
- The properties describe the fundamental structure of a tree in graph theory.
